The benefits of xSpectre's _Swiss army knife for soil sensing_ are: on demand, rapid and cost-effective soil characterisation in real-time. This information in turn supports, complements or substitutes three distinctive markets:

- Precision farming,
- Soil fertility testing, and
- Soil carbon credits.

In addition also the value of the global soil testing equipment market is summarised below.

#### Precision farming

The global [Total Available Market (TAM) for precision farming](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/precision-farming-market-1243.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjwmouZBhDSARIsALYcouqj1j8QXxHTqP9hHhYNm6kLNdVVkGlyzEVhD9K0IPKtvcj2_DZ4uJQaAvKjEALw_wcB) is expected to grow from USD 8.5 billion in 2022 to USD 15.6 billion by 2030, at a Compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.9%.

This market is driven both by technological and economical factors. The technological factors are linked to the general development summarised as Internet-of-Things (IoT), with developments in all parts of the chain formed by sensors, networks, applications, computer modeling power and actuators (Fig 1). The economic factors are primarily cost savings, in e.g. man-power, machinery, fossil fuel consumption and fertiliser use, rather than increases in yields. A growing economic factor is the development of soil carbon markets promoted by governments worldwide. Only a small portion of the global TAM regards sensors for soil conditions. Estimating the Serviceable Available Market (SAM), both thematically and geographially is near impossible. What is rather certain, however, is that the sensing sector is most likely growing faster than other parts of the smart farming chain (fig. 1).

#### Soil fertility testing

[Research and Markets](https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/5394045/soil-fertility-testing-market-forecast-to-2028) estimates the global (TAM) market for soil fertility testing to grow from USD 4.3 billion in 2020 to USD 5.9 billion by 2028, at a CAGR of 4.1%. [Persistence Market Research](https://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/market-research/soil-fertility-testing-market.asp) put the value of the present market to only 1.5 billion USD but with an expected CAGR of 6.1 %. The top players hold more than 60% of the market share. They include SGS SA, Eurofins Agri Testing, ALS Ltd., AgroLab, and Actlabs. The global region with the largest market growth is Asia-Pacific due to increased consumption of fertilizers in big arable land available.

Sweden has no legal requirements regarding soil fertility testing; the [recommendation is a single test per hectare every 7th years](https://www2.jordbruksverket.se/webdav/files/SJV/trycksaker/Pdf_jo/jo10_19.pdf). The Swedish market for soil fertility testing was thus approximately 15 million USD in 2020. Due to demands raised by the European Union the number of soil samples taken has more that doubled from 2020 to 2022. Whether this trend will continue or recede is uncertain. This means the SAM for soil fertility testing in Sweden could be estimated at 15 to 30 M USD per annum, but with a very uncertain growth rate.

The soil fertility testing referred to here is the classical wet laboratory (physical, chemical, and biological) testing to determine the growth potential of soil, indicating inadequacies of nutrients, potential toxicity caused by excessive fertility, and inhibitions due to non-essential trace minerals. It does not include testing required for a soil carbon market.

xSpectre's Swiss army knife soil testing concept brings benefits for the agricultural consultants that often do the soil testing (see section on [competition](../../competition)) - by allowing sampling a more dense grid of points at very low costs by using spectral modelling for extrapolating wet laboratory results. The relative low cost of xSpectre's spectrometers also opens for individual farmers to directly test soils in real time at negligible marginal costs. This is a novel and untested market, but the interest exists - given that the technology can be proven (see trainne report at bottom of page).

#### Soil carbon credits

The market for soil carbon credits, primarily in North America and Australia is growing, but it is a disparate market that lacks accepted standards.

xSpectre's pocket sized soil laboratory could become a tool for standardising Monitoring, Reporting and Validation (MRV) of soil carbon credits. The size of the (future) soil sampling required for establishing an MRV of soil carbon credit markets is unknown. What is certain, however, is that new methods for rapid and cost-effective soil characterisation in real-time, with proven accuracy, will lead to a more rapid growth of this market.

#### Soil Testing Equipment Market

A report released in April 2021 advertised by [Report Linker](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/27/2237554/0/en/Global-Soil-Testing-Equipment-Market-to-Reach-6-7-Billion-by-2027.html) estimate the present (2020) TAM value of the Global Soil Testing Equipment Market at $3.6 Billion, to reach $6.7 Billion by 2027.

#### Serviceable Obtainable Market

We have put figures on the existing Total Available Markets (TAMs), but these figures lack the emerging market for MRV of soil carbon credits. We presume the later to be a, if not the most, important market for xSpectre's pocket sized soil sensor. Estimating either the Serviceable Available Market (SAM) for a geographical region and/or sector within the TAMs, or a Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM) where xSpectre's handheld spectrometer+ could win market shares, is nearly impossible at this stage.
