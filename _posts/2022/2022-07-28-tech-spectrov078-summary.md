### Introduction

Version 0.78 of xSpectre handheld spectrometer+ is built around a customised Printed Circuit Board (PCB). The breakout boards used in previous models are replaced with a single PCB.

The central microprocessor in version 0.78 is an [Adafruit Feather nRF52840](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4062). The microprocessor comes built-in with e.g. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and functions and connections for a LiPo battery.

<br>
Other changes in the hardware design of version 0.78 include:

- stabilized and software-controlled energy supply of different types of light sources,
- attachment of different light sources and sample holders with bayonet mount,
- 5 pin connection to light sources to enable information exchange and automated power adjustments,
- 8-pin GX16 aviator plug for general purpose external sensors and probes, and
- built-in BNC connector for Ion Selective Electrodes.

### Spectral sensors

The PCB of v 0.78 is prepared for using 3 different spectral [miniature Hamamatsu sensors](https://www.hamamatsu.com/eu/en/product/photometry-systems/mini-spectrometer/selection-guide.html):

- [C12666MA, @ 340 - 780 nm](https://www.hamamatsu.com/eu/en/product/optical-sensors/spectrometers/mini-spectrometer/C12666MA.html),
- [C12880MA @ 340 - 850 nm](https://www.hamamatsu.com/all/en/product/optical-sensors/spectrometers/mini-spectrometer/C12880MA.html), and
- [C14384MA-01 @ 600 - 1050 nm](https://www.hamamatsu.com/all/en/product/optical-sensors/spectrometers/mini-spectrometer/C14384MA-01.html).

The wiring for the three sensors are similar and the PCB has prepared ports for mounting all three. C12666MA and C12880MA are built using identical containers while the smaller C14384MA-01 is different. The latter requires a silicon padding fitted inside a connection socket with connection pins corresponding to the C12666MA/C12880MA container.

### External ports

Version 0.78 is equipped with two external expansion connections: a BNC (coaxial) connector mainly for Ion Selective Electrodes (ISEs), and a GX16 (aviation) plug for general sensors. The BNC connector is soldered directly on the customised PCB and its use is straight forward. The GX16 aviation plug is connected to the PCB with 8 pins, and the wiring of each device linked via the GX16 plug need to be designed regarding the power needs and communication protocol.

### Light sources/sample holders

The light and sample holding muzzles for v0.78 were redesigned to be built with a new customised Printed Circuit Board (PCB).

### Light source PCB

![light-PCB](../../images/xspectre_light-source-pcb_01.png)
{: .pull-right}
Version 0.78 comes with a customised light-PCB (20x30 mm) for the light holder muzzle. The light-PCB fulfils 4 objectives:

- connecting different light sources to the spectrometer,
- holding the light source in place,
- holding the female right angle 5-pin POGO in place, and
- hosting a 1-wire memory chip defining the light source.

### pogo 5-pin connection

![pogo-5-pin_right-angle](../../images/pogo-5-pin_right-angle_female+male.png)
{: .pull-right}
The connection between the spectrometer and the light muzzle is accomplished with a female and a male 5-pin POGO connector, both with right angle solder pins.

### Bayonet and pogo pin connections
