<h2>Smart farming for improved livelihoods and climate benefits</h2>

Smart farming is a fast-growing market that is also developing towards regenerative agriculture and the potential of climate neutral, or even carbon capturing, farming. Soil carbon sequestration has also recently emerged as a market place for carbon credits on its own. The core of smart farming is a combination of sensors, Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and actuators. <br><br>

xSpectre has developed a solution to easily and cost-effectively gather local knowledge on soil properties which can then be used either for stand-alone smart or regenerative agriculture or for improving existing precision farming systems operated from satellite or drone images. The solution consists of a handheld spectrometer with external sensors for soil chemical and physical properties, a mobile app, and a system for modeling, analysis and visualization of the local data.<br><br>

xSpectre innovation is simply a swiss army knife for soil sensing, developed to support, complement or substitute three distinctive markets:<br><br>

- smart farming,<br>
- soil fertility testing, and<br>
- soil carbon credits.
